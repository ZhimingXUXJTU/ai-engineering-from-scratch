## The Problem | 问题引入

Before transformers, before RNNs, before word embeddings, a language model predicted the next word by counting how often it followed the previous `n-1` words. Count "the cat" → "sat" 47 times, "the cat" → "jumped" 12 times, "the cat" → "refrigerator" 0 times. Normalize to get a probability distribution.

That is an n-gram language model. It ran every speech recognizer, every spell checker, and every phrase-based machine translation system from 1980 through 2015. It still runs when you need cheap on-device language modeling.

The interesting problem is what to do about unseen n-grams. A raw count-based model assigns zero probability to anything it has not seen, which is catastrophic because sentences are long and almost every long sentence contains at least one unseen sequence. Fifty years of smoothing research fixed that. Kneser-Ney smoothing is the result, and modern deep learning inherited its empirical tradition.

**N-gram probability:** `P(w_i | w_{i-n+1}, ..., w_{i-1})`. Fix `n` (typically 3 for trigrams, 4 for 4-grams). Compute from counts:

**The zero-count problem.** Any n-gram not seen in training gets probability zero. A 2007 study on the Brown corpus found that even a 4-gram model had 30% of held-out 4-grams unseen in training. You cannot evaluate on any real text without smoothing.

**Smoothing approaches, in order of sophistication:**
> **Smoothing approaches, in order of sophistication:**

1. **Laplace (add-one).** Add 1 to every count. Simple, terrible on rare events.
2. **Good-Turing.** Reallocate probability mass from higher-frequency events to unseen ones based on frequency-of-frequencies.
3. **Interpolation.** Combine n-gram, (n-1)-gram, etc., estimates with tunable weights.
4. **Backoff.** If n-gram has count zero, fall back to (n-1)-gram. Katz backoff normalizes this.
5. **Absolute discounting.** Subtract a fixed discount `D` from all counts, redistribute to unseen.
6. **Kneser-Ney.** Absolute discounting plus a clever choice for the lower-order model: use *continuation probability* (how many contexts a word appears in) instead of raw frequency.

The Kneser-Ney insight is deep. "San Francisco" is a common bigram. Unigram "Francisco" appears mostly after "San." Naive absolute discounting gives "Francisco" high unigram probability (because the count is high). Kneser-Ney notices that "Francisco" appears in only one context and lowers its continuation probability accordingly. Result: a novel bigram ending in "Francisco" gets the appropriate low probability.

**Evaluation: perplexity.** The exponent of the average negative log-likelihood per word on a held-out test set. Lower is better. A perplexity of 100 means the model is as confused as it would be choosing uniformly among 100 words.

## Build It | 动手实现

### Step 1: trigram counts
> Input is a list of tokenized sentences. Output is n-gram counts and context counts. `<s>` and `</s>` are sentence boundaries.

```python
from collections import Counter, defaultdict


def train_ngram(corpus_tokens, n=3):
    ngrams = Counter()
    contexts = Counter()
    for sentence in corpus_tokens:
        padded = ["<s>"] * (n - 1) + sentence + ["</s>"]
        for i in range(len(padded) - n + 1):
            ctx = tuple(padded[i:i + n - 1])
            word = padded[i + n - 1]
            ngrams[ctx + (word,)] += 1
            contexts[ctx] += 1
    return ngrams, contexts


def raw_probability(ngrams, contexts, context, word):
    ctx = tuple(context)
    if contexts.get(ctx, 0) == 0:
        return 0.0
    return ngrams.get(ctx + (word,), 0) / contexts[ctx]
```

Input is a list of tokenized sentences. Output is n-gram counts and context counts. `<s>` and `</s>` are sentence boundaries.
> Add 1 to every count. Smooths but over-allocates mass to unseen events, hurting rare-known events too.

### Step 2: Laplace smoothing
> Three moving parts. `continuation_prob` captures "how many different contexts does this word appear in?" (the Kneser-Ney innovation). `lambda_prev` is the mass freed by the discount, used to weight the backoff. The final probability is the discounted main term plus the weighted continuation term.

```python
def laplace_probability(ngrams, contexts, vocab_size, context, word):
    ctx = tuple(context)
    numerator = ngrams.get(ctx + (word,), 0) + 1
    denominator = contexts.get(ctx, 0) + vocab_size
    return numerator / denominator
```

Add 1 to every count. Smooths but over-allocates mass to unseen events, hurting rare-known events too.
> Sampling proportional to probability. Always gives different output per seed. For beam-search-like output, pick the argmax at each step (greedy) and add a small randomness knob (temperature).

### Step 3: Kneser-Ney (bigram, interpolated)
> Lower is better. For Brown corpus, a well-tuned 4-gram KN model hits perplexity around 140. A transformer LM hits 15-30 on the same test set. The gap is about 10x. That gap is why the field moved on.

```python
def kneser_ney_bigram_model(corpus_tokens, discount=0.75):
    unigrams = Counter()
    bigrams = Counter()
    unigram_contexts = defaultdict(set)

    for sentence in corpus_tokens:
        padded = ["<s>"] + sentence + ["</s>"]
        for i, w in enumerate(padded):
            unigrams[w] += 1
            if i > 0:
                prev = padded[i - 1]
                bigrams[(prev, w)] += 1
                unigram_contexts[w].add(prev)

    total_unique_bigrams = sum(len(ctx_set) for ctx_set in unigram_contexts.values())
    continuation_prob = {
        w: len(ctx_set) / total_unique_bigrams for w, ctx_set in unigram_contexts.items()
    }

    context_totals = Counter()
    for (prev, w), count in bigrams.items():
        context_totals[prev] += count

    unique_follow = defaultdict(set)
    for (prev, w) in bigrams:
        unique_follow[prev].add(w)

    def prob(prev, w):
        count = bigrams.get((prev, w), 0)
        denom = context_totals.get(prev, 0)
        if denom == 0:
            return continuation_prob.get(w, 1e-9)
        first_term = max(count - discount, 0) / denom
        lambda_prev = discount * len(unique_follow[prev]) / denom
        return first_term + lambda_prev * continuation_prob.get(w, 1e-9)

    return prob
```

Three moving parts. `continuation_prob` captures "how many different contexts does this word appear in?" (the Kneser-Ney innovation). `lambda_prev` is the mass freed by the discount, used to weight the backoff. The final probability is the discounted main term plus the weighted continuation term.

### Step 4: generating text with sampling

```python
import random


def generate(prob_fn, vocab, prefix, max_len=30, seed=0):
    rng = random.Random(seed)
    tokens = list(prefix)
    for _ in range(max_len):
        candidates = [(w, prob_fn(tokens[-1], w)) for w in vocab]
        total = sum(p for _, p in candidates)
        r = rng.random() * total
        acc = 0.0
        for w, p in candidates:
            acc += p
            if r <= acc:
                tokens.append(w)
                break
        if tokens[-1] == "</s>":
            break
    return tokens
```

Sampling proportional to probability. Always gives different output per seed. For beam-search-like output, pick the argmax at each step (greedy) and add a small randomness knob (temperature).

### Step 5: perplexity

```python
import math


def perplexity(prob_fn, sentences):
    total_log_prob = 0.0
    total_tokens = 0
    for sentence in sentences:
        padded = ["<s>"] + sentence + ["</s>"]
        for i in range(1, len(padded)):
            p = prob_fn(padded[i - 1], padded[i])
            total_log_prob += math.log(max(p, 1e-12))
            total_tokens += 1
    return math.exp(-total_log_prob / total_tokens)
```

Lower is better. For Brown corpus, a well-tuned 4-gram KN model hits perplexity around 140. A transformer LM hits 15-30 on the same test set. The gap is about 10x. That gap is why the field moved on.

Given a corpus and target use (next-word prediction, rescoring, perplexity baseline), output:

1. N-gram order. Trigram for general English, 4-gram if corpus is large, 5-gram for speech rescoring.
2. Smoothing. Modified Kneser-Ney is the default; Laplace only for teaching.
3. Library. `kenlm` for production, `nltk.lm` for teaching, roll your own only to learn.
4. Evaluation. Held-out perplexity with consistent tokenization between train and test sets.

Refuse to report perplexity computed with different tokenization between systems being compared — perplexity numbers are comparable only under identical tokenization. Flag OOV rate in test set; KN handles OOV poorly unless you reserve a special <UNK> token during training.

1. **Easy.** Train a trigram LM on a 1,000-sentence Shakespeare corpus. Generate 20 sentences. They will be locally plausible but globally incoherent. This is the canonical demo.
2. **Medium.** Implement perplexity for your KN model on a held-out Shakespeare split. Compare against Laplace. You should see KN lower perplexity by 30-50%.
3. **Hard.** Build a trigram spell corrector: given a misspelled word and its context, generate corrections and rank by context probability under the LM. Evaluate on the Birkbeck spelling corpus (public).
