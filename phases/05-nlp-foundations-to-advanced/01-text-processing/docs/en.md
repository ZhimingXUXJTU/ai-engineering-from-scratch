## The Problem | 问题引入

A model cannot read "The cats were running." It reads integers.

Every NLP system opens with the same three questions. Where does a word start. What is the root of the word. How do we treat "run", "running", "ran" as the same thing when it helps, and as different things when it doesn't.

Get tokenization wrong and the model learns from garbage. If your tokenizer treats `don't` as one token but `do n't` as two, the training distribution splits. If your stemmer collapses `organization` and `organ` to the same stem, topic modeling dies. If your lemmatizer needs part-of-speech context but you don't pass it, verbs get treated as nouns.

This lesson builds the three preprocessing steps from scratch, then shows how NLTK and spaCy do the same work so you can see the tradeoffs.

## The Concept | 核心概念

> **【中文解读】** 本节介绍核心概念和理论基础。掌握这些概念是后续动手实现的前提，同时也是面试和工程实践中高频考察的知识点。


Three operations. Each has a job and a failure mode.

**Tokenization** splits a string into tokens. "Token" is deliberately vague because the right granularity depends on the task. Word-level for classical NLP. Subword for transformers. Character for languages without whitespace.

**Stemming** chops suffixes with rules. Fast, aggressive, dumb. `running -> run`. `organization -> organ`. That second one is the failure mode.

**Lemmatization** reduces a word to its dictionary form using grammar knowledge. Slower, accurate, needs a lookup table or morphological analyzer. `ran -> run` (needs to know "ran" is past tense of "run"). `better -> good` (needs to know comparative forms).

Rule of thumb. Stem when speed matters and you can tolerate noise (search indexing, rough classification). Lemmatize when meaning matters (question answering, semantic search, anything the user will read).

> **【拓展：大语言模型的工程实践】** 从 GPT 到 ChatGPT，NLP 领域经历了从 "每个任务训练一个模型" 到 "一个模型解决所有任务" 的范式转变。在实际工程中，LLM 的部署需要考虑 Token 限制、延迟、成本、安全审查等问题。LangChain、LlamaIndex 等框架简化了 LLM 应用的开发。

> **【拓展：RAG 与企业知识库】** 检索增强生成（RAG）是当前企业 AI 应用最流行的架构：将用户查询先检索相关文档片段，再将检索结果作为上下文喂给 LLM 生成答案。这种方式解决了 LLM 知识过时和幻觉问题。向量数据库（如 Milvus、Pinecone、Weaviate）是 RAG 系统的核心组件。

> **【拓展：NLP 的多语言挑战】** 全球有 7000+ 种语言，但 NLP 研究主要集中在英语等少数语言。跨语言迁移学习、多语言预训练模型（如 mBERT、XLM-R）是解决低资源语言 NLP 的主要方法。字节级模型（如 ByT5）甚至可以在无分词器的情况下处理任何语言。




## Build It | 动手实现

> **【中文解读】** 本节通过代码从零实现核心算法。这种 "from scratch" 的方式能帮助理解框架背后的原理，遇到问题时不会被黑盒困住。


### Step 1: a regex word tokenizer

The simplest useful tokenizer splits on non-alphanumeric characters while keeping punctuation as its own tokens. Not perfect, not final, but it runs in one line.

```python
import re

def tokenize(text):
    return re.findall(r"[A-Za-z]+(?:'[A-Za-z]+)?|[0-9]+|[^\sA-Za-z0-9]", text)
```

Three patterns in order of precedence. Words with optional inner apostrophe (`don't`, `it's`). Pure numbers. Any single non-whitespace non-alphanumeric character as a standalone token (punctuation).

```python
>>> tokenize("The cats weren't running at 3pm.")
['The', 'cats', "weren't", 'running', 'at', '3', 'pm', '.']
```

Failure modes to notice. `3pm` splits to `['3', 'pm']` because we alternated between letter runs and digit runs. Good enough for most tasks. URLs, emails, hashtags all break. For production, add patterns before the general ones.

### Step 2: a Porter stemmer (step 1a only)

The full Porter algorithm has five phases of rules. Step 1a alone covers the most frequent English suffixes and teaches the pattern.

```python
def stem_step_1a(word):
    if word.endswith("sses"):
        return word[:-2]
    if word.endswith("ies"):
        return word[:-2]
    if word.endswith("ss"):
        return word
    if word.endswith("s") and len(word) > 1:
        return word[:-1]
    return word
```

```python
>>> [stem_step_1a(w) for w in ["caresses", "ponies", "caress", "cats"]]
['caress', 'poni', 'caress', 'cat']
```

Read the rules top-down. The `ies -> i` rule is why `ponies -> poni`, not `pony`. Real Porter has step 1b that would fix it. Rules compete. Earlier rules win. The order matters more than any single rule.

### Step 3: a lookup-based lemmatizer

Lemmatization proper needs morphology. A tractable teaching version uses a small lemma table and a fallback.

```python
LEMMA_TABLE = {
    ("running", "VERB"): "run",
    ("ran", "VERB"): "run",
    ("runs", "VERB"): "run",
    ("better", "ADJ"): "good",
    ("best", "ADJ"): "good",
    ("cats", "NOUN"): "cat",
    ("cat", "NOUN"): "cat",
    ("were", "VERB"): "be",
    ("was", "VERB"): "be",
    ("is", "VERB"): "be",
}

def lemmatize(word, pos):
    key = (word.lower(), pos)
    if key in LEMMA_TABLE:
        return LEMMA_TABLE[key]
    if pos == "VERB" and word.endswith("ing"):
        return word[:-3]
    if pos == "NOUN" and word.endswith("s"):
        return word[:-1]
    return word.lower()
```

```python
>>> lemmatize("running", "VERB")
'run'
>>> lemmatize("cats", "NOUN")
'cat'
>>> lemmatize("better", "ADJ")
'good'
>>> lemmatize("watched", "VERB")
'watched'
```

The last case is the key teaching moment. `watched` is not in our table and our fallback only handles `ing`. Real lemmatization covers `ed`, irregular verbs, comparative adjectives, plurals with sound changes (`children -> child`). This is why production systems use WordNet, spaCy's morphologizer, or a full morphological analyzer.

### Step 4: pipe them together

```python
def preprocess(text, pos_tagger=None):
    tokens = tokenize(text)
    stems = [stem_step_1a(t.lower()) for t in tokens]
    tags = pos_tagger(tokens) if pos_tagger else [(t, "NOUN") for t in tokens]
    lemmas = [lemmatize(word, pos) for word, pos in tags]
    return {"tokens": tokens, "stems": stems, "lemmas": lemmas}
```

> **【中文解读】** 本节展示如何用成熟框架（如 PyTorch、HuggingFace 等）快速应用该技术。在实际项目中，优先使用经过验证的框架实现，可以减少 bug 并提高开发效率。


The missing piece is a POS tagger. Phase 5 · 07 (POS Tagging) builds one. For now, default everything to `NOUN` and acknowledge the limitation.

## Use It | 用框架实现

NLTK and spaCy ship the production versions. A few lines each.

### NLTK

```python
import nltk
nltk.download("punkt_tab")
nltk.download("wordnet")
nltk.download("averaged_perceptron_tagger_eng")

from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer
from nltk import pos_tag

text = "The cats were running."
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
stems = [PorterStemmer().stem(t) for t in tokens]
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
tagged = pos_tag(tokens)


def nltk_pos_to_wordnet(tag):
    if tag.startswith("V"):
        return "v"
    if tag.startswith("J"):
        return "a"
    if tag.startswith("R"):
        return "r"
    return "n"


lemmas = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(t, nltk_pos_to_wordnet(tag)) for t, tag in tagged]
```

`word_tokenize` handles contractions, Unicode, edge cases your regex misses. `PorterStemmer` runs all five phases. `WordNetLemmatizer` needs the POS tag translated from NLTK's Penn Treebank scheme to WordNet's abbreviation set. The translation wiring above is the bit most tutorials skip.

### spaCy

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp("The cats were running.")

for token in doc:
    print(token.text, token.lemma_, token.pos_)
```

```
The      the     DET
cats     cat     NOUN
were     be      AUX
running  run     VERB
.        .       PUNCT
```

spaCy hides the whole pipeline behind `nlp(text)`. Tokenization, POS tagging, and lemmatization all run. Faster than NLTK at scale. More accurate out of the box. The tradeoff is that you cannot easily swap individual components.

### When to pick which

| Situation | Pick |
|-----------|------|
| Teaching, research, swapping components | NLTK |
| Production, multi-language, speed matters | spaCy |
| Transformer pipeline (you'll tokenize with the model's tokenizer anyway) | Use `tokenizers` / `transformers` and skip classical preprocessing |

### The two failure modes nobody warns you about

Most tutorials teach the algorithms and stop. Two things will bite a real preprocessing pipeline, and they are almost never covered.

**Reproducibility drift.** NLTK and spaCy change tokenization and lemmatizer behavior between versions. What produced `['do', "n't"]` in spaCy 2.x may produce `["don't"]` in 3.x. Your model was trained on one distribution. Inference now runs on a different one. Accuracy quietly degrades and nobody knows why. Pin library versions in `requirements.txt`. Write a preprocessing regression test that freezes expected tokenization of 20 sample sentences. Run it on every upgrade.

**Training / inference mismatch.** Train with aggressive preprocessing (lowercase, stopword removal, stemming), deploy on raw user input, watch performance crater. This is the single most common production NLP failure. If you preprocess during training, you must run the identical function during inference. Ship preprocessing as a function inside the model package, not as a notebook cell the serving team rewrites.

A reusable prompt that helps engineers pick a preprocessing strategy without reading three textbooks.

Save as `outputs/prompt-preprocessing-advisor.md`:

```markdown
---
name: preprocessing-advisor
description: Recommends a tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization setup for an NLP task.
phase: 5
lesson: 01

You advise on classical NLP preprocessing. Given a task description, you output:

1. Tokenization choice (regex, NLTK word_tokenize, spaCy, or transformer tokenizer). Explain why.
2. Whether to stem, lemmatize, both, or neither. Explain why.
3. Specific library calls. Name the functions. Quote the POS-tag translation if NLTK is involved.
4. One failure mode the user should test for.

> **【中文解读】** 练习题按照 Easy/Medium/Hard 三个难度递进。建议至少完成 Medium 级别的题目，Hard 级别适合深入研究或面试准备。


Refuse to recommend stemming for user-visible text. Refuse to recommend lemmatization without POS tags. Flag non-English input as needing a different pipeline.
```

## Exercises | 练习题

1. **Easy.** Extend `tokenize` to keep URLs as single tokens. Test: `tokenize("Visit https://example.com today.")` should produce one URL token.
2. **Medium.** Implement Porter step 1b. If a word contains a vowel and ends in `ed` or `ing`, remove it. Handle the double-consonant rule (`hopping -> hop`, not `hopp`).
3. **Hard.** Build a lemmatizer that uses WordNet as a lookup table but falls back to your Porter stemmer when WordNet has no entry. Measure accuracy on a tagged corpus against plain WordNet and plain Porter.

## Key Terms | 术语速查表

| Term | What people say | What it actually means |
|------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| Token | A word | Whatever unit the model consumes. Can be word, subword, character, or byte. |
| Stem | Root of a word | Result of rule-based suffix stripping. Not always a real word. |
| Lemma | Dictionary form | The form you'd look up. Requires grammatical context to compute correctly. |
| POS tag | Part of speech | Category like NOUN, VERB, ADJ. Needed to lemmatize accurately. |
| Morphology | Word shape rules | How a word changes form based on tense, number, case. Lemmatization depends on it. |
