# Repo Memory and Durable State | 持久 记忆 状态 仓库

> Chat history is volatile. The repo is durable. The workbench stores agent state in versioned files so the next session, the next agent, and the next reviewer all read from the same source of truth.

**Type:** Build | **类型:** 构建
**Languages:** Python (stdlib + `jsonschema` optional) | **语言:** Python (标准库)
**Prerequisites:** Phase 14 · 32 (Minimal Workbench) | **前置知识:** 见原文
**Time:** ~60 minutes | **时间:** 见原文

## Learning Objectives | 学习目标

- Define what belongs in repo memory and what belongs in chat history.
- Author JSON Schemas for `agent_state.json` and `task_board.json`.
- Build a state manager that loads, validates, mutates, and persists state atomically.
- Use the schema to refuse bad writes before they corrupt the workbench.

## The Problem | 问题引入

The agent finishes a session. The chat closes. The next session opens and asks where to start. The model says "let me check the files," reads stale notes, and re-does work that was already complete. Or worse, it rewrites a finished file because no one told it the file was finished.

> Agent 完成一个会话。聊天关闭。下一个会话打开并问从哪里开始。模型说"让我检查文件"，读取过时的笔记，重新做已经完成的工作。或者更糟，它重写了一个已完成的文件，因为没有人告诉它文件已完成。

The workbench fix is repo memory: state lives in JSON files in the repo, written under a schema, persisted atomically, diff-friendly in code review. Chat is a transient feed; the repo is the system of record.

> 工作台的修复是仓库记忆：状态存在于仓库中的 JSON 文件中，在 schema 下写入，原子化持久化，在代码审查中友好 diff。聊天是瞬态流；仓库是记录的系统。

### What belongs in repo memory

| Belongs | Does not belong |
|---------|-----------------|
| Active task id | Raw chat transcripts |
| Touched files this session | Token-level reasoning traces |
| Assumptions the agent made | "The user seemed frustrated" |
| Open blockers | Sampled completions |
| Next action | Vendor-specific model ids |

The test is durability: would this be useful three months from now in a CI rerun? If yes, repo. If no, telemetry.

### Schema-first state

JSON Schema is the contract. Without it, every agent invents new fields, every reviewer learns a new shape, and every CI script has to special-case past versions. With it, a bad write is a refused write.

The schema covers:

- Required keys.
- Allowed `status` values.
- Forbidden values (e.g. `null` for arrays).
- Pattern constraints (task ids match `T-\d{3,}`).
- Version field for migrations.

### Atomic writes

State writes need to survive partial failures: write to a tempfile, fsync, rename over the target. The state file is the source of truth; a half-written one is worse than no file at all.

### Migrations

When the schema changes, ship a migration script next to the schema bump. The state file carries a `schema_version` field; the manager refuses to load a file from a version it cannot migrate.

## Build It | 动手实现

`code/main.py` implements:

- `agent_state.schema.json` and `task_board.schema.json`.
- A stdlib-only validator (subset of JSON Schema: required, type, enum, pattern, items).
- `StateManager.load`, `StateManager.update`, `StateManager.commit` with atomic temp-and-rename writes.
- A demo that mutates state, persists, reloads, and proves the round-trip.

Run it:

```
python3 code/main.py
```

The script writes `workdir/agent_state.json` and `workdir/task_board.json`, mutates them across two turns, and prints the validated state at each step.

## Production patterns in the wild

Four patterns turn the lesson's minimum into something a multi-agent monorepo can survive.

**Atomic temp-and-rename is not optional.** A March 2026 Hive project bug report documents the failure mode cleanly: `state.json` was written via `write_text()` and exceptions were caught and silenced. Partial writes left sessions resuming against corrupt state with no signal. The fix is always: `tempfile.mkstemp` in the same directory as the target, write, `fsync`, `os.replace` (atomic rename on POSIX and Windows). This lesson's `atomic_write` does exactly that.

**Idempotency keys on every non-idempotent tool call.** If an agent crashes after calling a tool but before checkpointing the result, recovery retries the tool call. Safe for reads; dangerous for emails, DB inserts, file uploads. The pattern: log every tool call ID before execution into a `pending_calls.jsonl`. On retry, check for the ID; if present, skip the call and use the cached result. Anthropic and LangChain both call this out in 2026 guidance; LangGraph's checkpointer persists pending writes for the same reason.

**Separate large artifacts from state.** Don't store CSVs, long transcripts, or generated files in `agent_state.json`. Save the artifact as a separate file (or upload to object storage) and keep only the path in state. Checkpoints stay small and fast; the artifacts grow independently.

**Event sourcing for audit, snapshots for resume.** Append to an event log (`state.events.jsonl`) on every mutation; periodically snapshot to `state.json`. Resume reads the snapshot, then replays any events after the snapshot's timestamp. This costs more disk but lets you replay agent decisions verbatim — essential when debugging long-horizon runs. The same shape Postgres uses internally for WAL.

**Schema migrations or refuse to load.** The `schema_version` integer is the contract. When the manager loads a file at an unknown version, it refuses to read. Ship a migration script next to the schema bump; `tools/migrate_state.py` runs idempotently on every startup.

## Use It | 用框架实现

In production:

- **LangGraph checkpointers.** Same idea, different storage. The checkpointer persists graph state to SQLite, Postgres, or a custom backend. The schema this lesson teaches is what you reach for when the checkpointer dies and you need to read state by hand.
- **Letta memory blocks.** Persistent blocks with structured schemas (Phase 14 · 08). Same discipline scoped to long-running personas.
- **OpenAI Agents SDK session store.** Pluggable backends, schema-aware. The state file in this lesson is the local-file backend.

## Ship It | 产出物

`outputs/skill-state-schema.md` generates a project-specific JSON Schema pair (state + board), a Python `StateManager` wired to atomic writes, and a migration scaffold so the next schema bump does not break the workbench.
